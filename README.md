Udacity Nanodegree Project 3 - frontend-arcade-game
===============================
The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down.
There is a score panel keeping count of how many wins a player gets.

The start code was provided in the course rubric [here] (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).
